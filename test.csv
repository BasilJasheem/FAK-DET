I just wanted to say that I've compared the BMP bands with other resistance band products I've used and these bands are definitely more superior in both quality and strength.I also train with them myself, and enjoy the interchangeability of the bands, (it's more convenient for my clients when doing circuit training). I'm not really nervous that some part of the band is going to break if I'm hard on them, mainly because I've gone through literally hundreds of resistance bands over the years and BMP bands are by far the most durable I've had the chance to work with.I know their only rubber and rubber doesn't last forever, it just like anything else has a resistance threshold especially being used as much as I use them, but for the price their fantastic. I recommend these bands to all of my clients for traveling purposes and every day workouts.I feel that the design overall is tremendously better and being able to stack the bands on one handle creates a great workout not only for me, but my clients as well, A BIG PLUS. I also like the extras that are included in the package like the ankle strap and door anker, you don't get those with a lot of other packages and if you do, you have to pay more in order to get them most of the time.I even called BMP to drill down on their product even more because I believe in getting what I pay for and the customer service was impeccable. They answered all my questions, they were very personable and were extremely helpful. That's what impressed me the most, hence why I'm writing this.All-in-All, I'm really happy with my purchase and would recommend BMP bands to others and would also recommend them if you're planning on using bands for high intensity workouts such as the P90X program, aerobics classes and other circuit training exercises like I perform with my clients.

I have installed many different types of mounts, so I have a lot of experience with them.  The quality is decent, but there are some items of which you should be aware:* If you have a 600x400 VESA pattern mount on your TV (as I did for a 37&#34; LG), then be aware that the extension arms are &#34;maxed out&#34; at this size, which means you have zero flexibility.  Unfortunately for my TV, the center plate onto which the extension arms attach completely covered the inputs I needed to use.  This isn't completely the VideoSecu's problem, but since there is no flexibility at this size, I had to rig it together off-centered only using two screws on the bottom arms.* All of the mounts I have ever done have a tilt function, and this is by far the biggest pain I've ever dealt with.  Instead of using thumb screws, you have to use a wrench (cheap one included) to adjust the tilt.  It is much more difficult to get the TV held in place and tighten this way.* Similar to the above, the mount gives the ability to adjust leveling after it has been installed.  This is also done with a wrench, but it is a big pain and is very difficult to keep level (keeps slipping) even with a helper.* Lastly, be aware that when folded completely, the screen is not centered over the wall mount.  It is about 2-3&#34; to the left or right, depending on which way you fold the arms.  If you're looking for the flexibility of full motion but most of the time it will be against the wall, keep this in mind.",3,"No flexibility for 600x400 VESA pattern, Slips Easily",1389657600,"01 14, 2014",Electronics,0

I previously owed the 1950's DVD box set using the Bondi software as well, and this feels more refined and faster. I've been able to easy index various contributors and articles and save them for later.The quality of the scans aren't great. In some cases there are water stains or scribbles on the pages. It's possible that was the best they had, since let's face it I doubt Hugh Hefner and company were thinking of posterity early on in the magazine's run. Printing in particularly is pretty disappointing. At the very least it would have been nice to include the option to read transcribed text like Zinio and other software offers. That said, on a computer screen everything should be fairly readable.As others have mentioned, the quality of the pictures is also an issue. In fact I was really shocked to find out this 250gb harddrive has 215gb free. You'd think with all that space they'd scan these documents in a higher resolution, or at least offer some extras like separate folders with high-rez shots of Playmates. It seems like a lost opportunity which Playboy may be kicking themselves for now. When I inquired via email on the 1960's DVD box set they immediately offered me a [...] off coupon for this set, which would indicate it isn't selling as well as they had hoped.Which is kind of sad, because for all it's faults there is a goldmine of intellectual property on this hard drive.

After Bondi Digital put out the great Rolling Stone magazine compendium and the first edition of the Playboy decade series (the 50's and now the 60's), it was time to get to digitizing the whole collection. Playboy is the perfect subject for the Bondi treatment on so many levels - culturally, politically, aesthetically and yes even the advertising! (we love seeing ads from the 60's for things like the AMC's Javelin car, Hai Karate aftershave and a full set of Jack Nicklaus golf clubs for $199!)It's all there, every issue from Hef's famed Marilyn Monroe debut cover to Joanna Krupa's final cover of the first decade of the new millennium. One is stuck by many things, the calibre of the photography, the nature of the political times, decades of interviews (from all the legends you know, Norman Mailer to Woody Allen, Salman Rushdie to Bill Maher), even the print quality (a bit dot-screened in the early days to a much glossier look today.) Not to mention, of course, decades of beautiful babes from Anna Nicole to Pamela Anderson and virtually every Hollywood starlet of the last half century.The main thing, of course, is the functionality which through the digital domain allows the reader (viewer?) to browse every title by cover, date and decade, search for specific content (we read it for the articles, remember?) and view pages in full screen, double page and multiple levels of zoom formats. There are advanced search tools to even pare down your search across multiple parameters. One drawback: in keyword search you will be taken to the page of the word but the search term is not highlighted and your computer's `find' function may not work as well (at least on the Mac version we tested.) One nice feature is that the system supposedly allows you to create reading lists so you can add articles to a list for future reference and even export the list as well, (though we weren't quite sure how you get that feature to work and found nothing mentioning it in the documentation.)If there is a negative, it is perhaps that technology has advanced past the original CD-ROM curve that this series is based on. With the touchscreen, page-flip world of today (iPad, Kindle) and the shift towards cloud computing, it is only a matter of time before a new version of these compilations are expected by consumers. With this content already now digitized, it seem that such an item should be coming down the pike in the not-too-distant future. But for now, having the entire history of Playboy available and cross referenceable on a single hard drive. We'll take it.",5,Playboy - Cover to Cover (Bondi Digital Publishing),1303084800,"04 18, 2011",Electronics,1
