I've ordered phones on Amazon before and they came in the same type of envelope but they always had some warping or a plastic wrap on it to at least look a little professional. the phone case itself isn't to bad but isn't great. the way the packaged the case and showed themselves as a company is sad. they just threw it in a envelope and sent it off and changed me more the the price of the case for shipping. DONT BUY!!!! i hope SawgNation sees this. this is ridiculous and i hope to be refunded for the &#34;shipping&#34; they did &#62;:(,1,im just disapointed,1369872000,"05 30, 2013",Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,0

650,5a1321d5741a2384e802c6a1,A33IJGLTVS5MDS,3283005737,Trailman,9,"When I made the decision to spend $1593.75 (including shipping) on my charcoal Glass II Explorer last November, I had expectations for what I could use it for. Here is a report on what those were, what other uses I discovered, and how Glass fared in regard to each use.A better action video camera?I had high hopes for Google Glass to be a replacement for my $50 bullet camera with better battery life, better image quality (because of the wide-angle lense) and better operability (because I see what it records and can pause it etc).The verdict: Glass fails in this category. The battery life is even shorter (30 minutes tops with a full battery right off the charger). I can wear it under my aero-helmet, but not without feeling pressure. This is a no-go on even the shortest bike rides or runs. The low-light capability is not great, either, and on my night runs with a head light there is not much to see on the resulting video.It does not fit under or over ski goggles, and the clear or active shades do not replace goggles (too small and too much draft that will tear up eyes at higher speeds).An in-vehicle or dashboard camera?A camera that reliably and continuously records what happens around me when I drive would be great. Glass is promising, because it captures my field of view, including the rear view mirror, but it is not reliable and cannot record continuously. When plugged in, the battery life would be no issue, but there is currently no app that records continuously (and overwrites earlier clips when memory runs out). Also, the display is always on when it records video, which is bothersome at night.With a little bit of practice it is possible to wake up Glass and get into video recording mode in a matter of a few seconds, but that is not fast enough in unexpected situations.My verdict: I think that the device has potential in this category with the right software. Currently it is limited.A better run/ride tracker?I saw that Strava has Glass apps even before I placed my Glass order, and I uploaded my entire workout history from Garmin to Strava in anticipation of using their apps with Glass.The verdict: Glass fails in this category, but my reasoning requires explanation, because admittedly this is the fault of my Nexus 5 and not so much the fault of Glass. Glass relies on the GPS sensor of the phone, and the Strava app only works when the phone is paired. Unfortunately my Nexus 5s GPS sensor data appears to be very inaccurate. When I started a ""Run"" on Strava while walking the dog, it placed me some 50 yards away from the road that I was on. I will continue to depend on the good old Garmin 305 in the coming years.In addition to issue with GPS accuracy, I don't take Glass on runs because I sweat a lot from the head and both the power button and the bone-conduction speaker would be exposed and allow sweat (or rain water!) to enter the device.A better headset?A resounding no here. The bone conduction speaker vibrates and tickles behind my ear. Having longer conversations on Glass is uncomfortable. The sound quality is moderate at best, and many times there is some kind of mechanical obstruction that causes strong distortions, to a point where I cannot understand the other party. I keep my Glass clean and protected, so I am not sure what causes the distortion. Maybe a tiny dust particle is all it takes.The ear bud speaker that is now included with Glass is too cumbersome to deal with for me. Glass is already bulky and in the way when you take if off because you can't simply fold it and put it in your shirt pocket. Now having something dangling on a USB cord attached to Glass is a non-starter. I have not even taken the ear bud out of the box yet.A hands-free smart phone controller?Being able to control important features of your phone without actually having to look at it or even hold in your hand is a compelling feature. If you use Gmail and Hangouts exclusively, you are being well-served by Glass. You will be alerted by and can read instant messages. and respond to and write instant messages and emails by using the voice recognition that works pretty reliably for me.I don't seem to be able to create emails from scratch, only instant messages to one of up to 10 contacts. I do see emails in my Gmail inbox, though. They appear as a new slide in the timeline and I can respond to them without ever touching Glass. This is pretty cool.The verdict: Unfortunately, I use neither Gmail nor Hangouts, and I frankly don't get Hangouts. I cannot access emails on my company's Exchange server or my personal IMAP service from Glass, and while I have over 1,000 contacts on my phone, I only see 14 contacts on Glass. This pretty much renders Glass useless as a communication device.A better navigation device?I really like the way navigation works. I have one car with a built-in navigation system and will not use Glass there - it certainly does not compete with the Mercedes Comand System. In my other car I do not have a navigation system at all, and previously I had to meddle with the phone when I needed directions. This works so much better on Glass.My verdict: Navigation is definitely a compelling use of the product, in the car as well as on the bike or on foot (even though Google Maps lacks trail data). Based on some recent incidents that made national headlines, it appears that there is currently doubt among law enforcement officers whether using Glass while driving is legal and safe. I can attest that it can be surprising and distracting when Glass comes to live in full brightness during a night drive to alert you of an upcoming turn, but I don't find it all that different from having a GPS device in the car that is on all the time.A better music streaming device?With access to Google Music and completely hands-free operation through voice-activated searches, Glass offers yet another compelling use.My verdict: Exciting possibilities, but currently we have to compromise on either poor audio quality or complicated handling/wiring of ear buds. The mono ear bud that comes with Glass is, well, mono only; stereo ear buds are available for an extra $85, and my ears aren't made for ear bud-type headphones anyway. They tend to hurt and fall out, and the same is true for the ear bud that came with Glass. Overall, I am somewhat indifferent about Glass' current usefulness as a music streaming device.Other uses?Glassware can be installed from the phone or the computer. The current selection of applications that work with Glass is limited (I just counted 35), which I find surprising, given how long Glass has been available to the development community already.My verdict: The speed of adoption among application developers seems to be slow and the number of available applications is small. I am confident that this will change. Still, no more than a null-vote on other uses at this time.A mature and well-tested device?I run into odd and unexpected situations with Glass almost daily that require some tinkering to figure out. Examples?*The on-head detection is flakey and sometimes shuts off Glass unexpectedly. I figured this out myself and the chatter on the Explorer forums confirmed my diagnosis. I just disabled this feature entirely.*The ""Ok Glass"" command stopped working on the 3rd day. I had to do a factory reset to get it back.*When I did a factory reset, it took several attempts and an uninstall of the MyGlass app on the Nexus 5 before I was able to pair them again. Glass would just not get into pairing mode.*Currently, phone calls or navigation don't work while on a Wifi connection, even though I am paired and connected with the Nexus 5. There is no way to ""disable"" the wireless connection temporarily. You have to make Glass ""Forget"" the connection to make a call and then recreate it. The phone reports the Bluetooth profile ""Phone Audio"", not ""Headset"" as one would expect.*I am perpetually confused by what contacts I get to see on Glass. I understand that I can add up to 10 contacts from my phone that will show up on Glass as separate slides. So far I added 5 contacts. When I want to make a phone call, I am presented with 14 contact choices, though, the same people that appear in my Hangouts on Google. With half of them I have had no contact in years and I don't have the slightest idea how they ended up there.My overall verdict:The head-mounted display and its possibilities are exciting and an indication that this technology will become pervasive in the very near future. But Glass appears to still be an experimental device that does not excel in any particular discipline, comes with a high price tag, and that non-techie consumers will struggle with. The short battery life severely limits its practical use and spoils the fun.I no longer keep my Glass charged and use it maybe once a month. It still works as a conversation-starter.

I've worked in the golf publishing business for nearly 20 years and have never seen a step-by-step guide that explains how the best junior golfers continue to improve and reach their full potential until Journey to Excellence. It took someone of Henry Brunton's credentials to finally pull all the key information into one resource. Brunton is the Head Coach for the Canadian National Men's Team, he is the only Canadian ever named one of GOLF Magazine's Top 100 Teachers, he is the creator of the teaching curriculum used by the Canadian PGA and near Toronto he runs one of the finest regional junior programs in the world for competitive juniors. A program that has been emulated by instructors all over North America.Journey to Excellence details the intricacies of every major issue that a young competitive golfer will face while trying to become the best they can be. From equipment issues, to finding the right coach, to managing emotions to understanding how to earn a college scholarship, it's all right here in a breezy read filled with anecdotes from the game's best players who have already reached their full potential in the game.Brunton saw the need for providing honest, accurate information to the next generation of competitive golfers and spent two years working on this manuscript. It was a labor of love and it shows in the final work. I've been fortunate to know Henry for nearly 15 years and he is a major force who will lead junior golf in a positive direction for years to come.

Brunton, a member of the Canadian PGA since 1984, is a CPGA Master Professional, Canada's National Coach since 1999, a U.S. Kids Golf Top 50 Kids Teacher and a member of the Titleist Performance Institute's Junior Advisory Board. He knows a lot about golf in general and in particular what life is like for young people with aspirations to become collegiate golfers and touring pros.For those young golfers who have fallen in love with game, who dream of being the next Tiger or Annika (and for the parents and coaches who will help them achieve their goals), ""Journey to Excellence"" is a delightfully supportive but also down-to-earth, realistic guide to becoming the best golfers they can be.

Instead, it's much wiser to take the steps necessary to balance the demands of golf and the other realities of your life so that both spheres benefit,"" Brunton writes.But Brunton is clear that the journey begins with the fun of playing golf. ""For some reason, some people--a lot of people-- have fun trying to move that white ball. There are a lot of things about it that make it fun: the company is almost always good--no one is introduced to golf by people they don't like..."" Brunton writes on Page 1.

There is a chapter on how to get clubs that fit properly. How to find a coach, maximizing practice sessions to fit a young golfer's age, needs and personality; principles for self management including mental and physical training and nutrition needs; and developing a plan to win are all topics covered in this handbook.

Up until this year, though, I was horribly inconsistent at it.  So much so that I was often embarrassed to go out and play in club outings, tournaments, etc.  I would come home so down on myself.  I said I was going to quit so many times.This year things changed.  I was sitting at a party and this guy started boring me about this book he read and how it changed his game.  Yeah, yeah, I thought.  But then I went on to Amazon and looked it up.  $10 bucks.  I figured its got to be worth a try.Unbelievable!This book is so simple.  I have spent $100's or even $1,000's of dollars on golf lessons over the years and NONE of them came even 1/2 way to what this book has done for me (golf pros should be ashamed at themselves!  They make you do these goofy things and they don't focus on the fundamentals).  I read it three times in about a day and a half.  The third time I read it with my club by my side (to try grips, etc.).  The biggest breakthroughs for me were the grip (I had been doing it totally wrong for years) and the pattern of the on-plane arms, shoulders hips backswing to the hips, shoulders arms forward swing.  Again, unbelievable!  I hit it straighter, farther, etc. etc.  It is so much fun!  I feel like I actually know how to play the game!

147,5a132768741a2384e847b936,A2VQUXAGEGNUX1,0743273575,"Oscar Rubenstein ""Oscar""",4,"So here is the backdrop.  I've been golfing off and on for 20 years (I am 45 now).  I LOVE the game.  Up until this year, though, I was horribly inconsistent at it.  So much so that I was often embarrassed to go out and play in club outings, tournaments, etc.  I would come home so down on myself.  I said I was going to quit so many times.This year things changed.  I was sitting at a party and this guy started boring me about this book he read and how it changed his game.  Yeah, yeah, I thought.  But then I went on to Amazon and looked it up.  $10 bucks.  I figured its got to be worth a try.Unbelievable!This book is so simple.  I have spent $100's or even $1,000's of dollars on golf lessons over the years and NONE of them came even 1/2 way to what this book has done for me (golf pros should be ashamed at themselves!  They make you do these goofy things and they don't focus on the fundamentals).  I read it three times in about a day and a half.  The third time I read it with my club by my side (to try grips, etc.).  The biggest breakthroughs for me were the grip (I had been doing it totally wrong for years) and the pattern of the on-plane arms, shoulders hips backswing to the hips, shoulders arms forward swing.  Again, unbelievable!  I hit it straighter, farther, etc. etc.  It is so much fun!  I feel like I actually know how to play the game!  And when I start to go off kilter a little bit, I go back to Hogan's fundamentals and it all comes back.  It's weird, I have been swinging wrong for so long...that doing it his way feels weird...but I'm coming to just trust it and not think about it...and I have more confidence to swing hard and just let it deliver.",5,The best $10 you've ever spent.,1323043200,"12 5, 2011",Sports_and_Outdoors,1

I've read lots of books, watched DVDs, watched other fly fishers on the water but this woman will really get the points across to you. The how's and why's. Lots of easy to remember pointers for where your hand, line, leader, fly, ect. should be at any point during the cast, and in any type of cast, and any type of water, so you will recognize where your mistakes are being made! If you're like me, so OCD you are CDO, you're going to feast on Joan's technical, yet simple, teaching style. Totally different from any other fly casting material I've experienced. She explains and demonstrates why the old 10 o'clock to 2 o'clock, keeping your casting arm pinned to the body casting technique just isn't realistic. I'm a petite female and once Joan taught me it was ok to let my arm and rod go up and away from my body wow!, I had so much more power in my cast!  The best point she made for me and what I now realize is the heart of the cast, is the ""power snap"". Once you understand that part of the cast, the rest follows easily. The first few times I got the power snap right it was a major fishing epiphany for me.  It felt so good, I knew it was right!  And you will discover that the ""power snap"" is as easy as ""opening a screen door"". lol! The first time I went out on the water after seeing her video, my casting accuracy and distance improved by at least 50%! I've got all her books now, I devour them like a fly casting pig. ""Joan Wulff's Fly Casting Accuracy"" is fabulous and is my favorite to date. I've fished with spin tackle all my life and its only after getting into fly fishing and reading Joan Wulff that I've really come to appreciate the beauty of the cast. If you want to understand the ""why"" which makes the ""how"" easier, Joan Wulff is the teacher for you. Her love and appreciation of the sport is obvious and translates thru any media on which you choose to get to know Joan Wulff. I'm sure you'll be glad you did.

If you are not familiar with it but want to start this style, it is best to take a class, not use a video. (a video can be great for getting an idea of what to expect, but you will not get the correction and instruction that meets your individual needs from a video)2. Each series in Ashtanga(first, second, third, etc) is always the same sequence of poses. It is designed that one masters each pose and then moves on to the next, eventually completing the series. When one masters the first series (and this might take many years) one moves on to the second.3. Three months of yoga, no matter how many days a week you do it still makes you a beginner. One of my instructors has said you are a beginner until you have 10 years of consistent daily practice. Maybe that is a bit of an overstatement...but maybe not. Part of yoga is letting go of ego and being present where you are, wherever that is.So, yes, this is not a video for someone brand new to yoga.

This video is not for entertainment, but for engaging in a challenging and real yoga practice.  I personally am impressed that they have not including many distracting elements which are normally present (music, chattiness, etc.)  Richard focuses on the breathing and will often say ""this is mainly a breathing exercise"" pointing us to the fact that the breath is at the heart of the yoga practice.  He also focuses on holding the mula and uddiyanda bandhas.  One fault I see with this is that while he seems to expect us to be holding and using them throughout the practice, he only reminds us to do so a few times.  Not being well practiced in this myself, I could use more reminders.  Many of the poses are VERY difficult, and if you are well versed in yoga, you will also find many of them familiar.  The complete ashtanga practice is about 1 hr 50 min long.  For myself I purchased his Introduction to Ashtanga for a shorter option which is 76 min long.  Also, this ""introduction"" has a little more instruction, goes a little slower, and has a few more  variations on the poses for those who are just starting out.In the Primary Series, I am also very impressed with Richard's flow through chatarunga, upward dog, and downward dog, then jumping forward to sit between his hands.  This flow is common in ashtanga and other flow forms of yoga based on ashtanga, so that is not new.  But his immense control, and precise setting down of his body is amazing.  I intend not only to practice along with this video, but also to watch it carefully at other times, when I'm not doing yoga, just to study his form and flow.Another focus of his is gazing.  Very often he gives directions of where your eyes should be focused -- on the thumbs, the tip of the nose, the middle of the forehead, the big toe, etc.  I like this.  If he was as attentive to giving instructions on the bandas as he is to gazing, then i would be 110% happy.I have been practicing yoga for about 5 years, but this is the first time I've done formal ashtanga.  I have been doing Shiva Rea's CDs for about 2 years, and she is based in ashtanga, I now see.  But I have not found myself sweating profusely doing this yoga DVD.

I am usually breathing so hard that I can't keep my ""breath together"" as he advises, but I have only just started the video two days ago.

Garcia ""Rocketrobert""",16,"In this day and age of modern gyms, overpaid personal trainers and expensive workout outfits, etc., Combat Conditioning is just what I was looking for!  I got it two years ago and have established a fitness level that a gym membership couldn't do.I'm a martial artist and the exercises in Combat Conditioning have given me great functional strength, explosive power, three times the flexibility and 4 times the stamina. The Hindu Squats were the saving-grace for my knees. I had a MCL tear a few years back and have always had to deal with pain, stiffness and instability. After getting Combat Conditioning and doing the Hindu Squats, my knees are stronger with more stability and the nagging pain has significantly decreased!I have read some of these reviews on Combat Conditioning and there seems to be a gripe and whine about the price. But in comparison to an $800 per year gym membership, not to mention the gas to get to and from there ( I live in California), Combat Conditioning is cheap!!!

Garcia ""Rocketrobert""",20,"In this day and age of modern gyms, overpaid personal trainers and expensive workout outfits, etc., Combat Conditioning is just what I was looking for!  I got it two years ago and have established a fitness level that a gym membership couldn't do.I'm a martial artist and the exercises in Combat Conditioning have given me great functional strength, explosive power, three times the flexibility and 4 times the stamina. The Hindu Squats were the saving-grace for my knees. I had a MCL tear a few years back and have always had to deal with pain, stiffness and instability. After getting Combat Conditioning and doing the Hindu Squats, my knees are stronger with more stability and the nagging pain has significantly decreased!I have read some of these reviews on Combat Conditioning and there seems to be a gripe and whine about the price. But in comparison to an $800 per year gym membership, not to mention the gas to get to and from there ( I live in California), Combat Conditioning is cheap!!! It is well worth the price, in fact, it is under priced if you ask me. I'm paid something like $45 directly from Matt Furey's website and then later got the videos for $99.

I have only watched the first DVD because it is so loaded with good information and technique that It will keep me busy for months perfecting my form.  This is the most thorough and accurate yoga DVD I have ever seen.  If you just want to casually work your way through a relaxing DVD with soft music and a scenic background then this is not the DVD for you.  If you want to do the poses correctly so you can safely do inversions and still be rock solid I HIGHLY recommend this DVD.  This is everything I wanted in a yoga DVD.  I have bought many and I am always left wanting.  Please remember my review is of the first of the two DVDs, but I imagine the second is just as good.  I am also coming back to yoga after many years of nothing so I guess you could call me an educated beginner????  I learned from books and DVDs so my form needs to be fine tuned and that is where Mathew's teaching style excels.Pro's1.  Everything is explained in crystal clear detail including angles of your feet and hands and how that affects the pose and your progress in the future.2.  Mathew's voice is pleasant to listen to.  I have one DVD that breaks my focus every time the instructor talks.3.  The teachings are methodical and in the perfect order to build strength before moving on to the next pose.4.  Inversions are taught in step by step increments building the balance and strength needed before doing the full inversion.  (I have only seen this done before with 1 or two increments.  His approach is much more thorough.)5.  I like the camera work and the plain background.  It doesn't distract you and the poses are very clear.6.  There is not a lot of fluff.  I am not a big fan of fluff.  If I want to know the history of yoga, I will study that on my own.  I do not want a 10 minute over generalized intro at the beginning of my DVD.7.  Based on my knowledge of yoga, his form seems to be perfect and his movements are so fluid it almost looks fake.  My niece actually thought we were pausing the video at one point.  That's what I aspire to be and some yoga DVD instructors look like they can barely do the pose themselves or the are using improper form which is both unsafe and limiting.Cons1. This isn't really the kind of DVD you can throw in and do as a workout.  There is the Sun Salute section which shows 5 different Sun Salutes from heavily modified to floating and jumping in and out.  I use that to go along with but it's really more of a demonstration.2.  It can be a little dry if you need a more inspirational feel.3.  His perfect form makes me feel like a wobbly fool, seeing as I am soooo out of condition right now.  I could see that as being a deterrent to the very beginner.  I just hold on to the memory I have from 15 years ago when I was the rock solid yoga junkie doing seemingly impossible poses despite my learning only from books and DVDs.  I will get there again.  Don't let that discourage you if you are a beginner.  It is better to learn proper form from the beginning than have to fix it later.4.  I hate when DVDs come in cardboard sleeves.  It guarantees they are going to get scratched before I remember to get a new case for them and then I have to cut the cardboard sleeve and try to find a way to keep it in the case I buy.  It's just an annoyance but it seems to happen a lot more these days.5.  He does this prayer thing at the beginning in another language with a caption in English.  I'm sure it's important to him.  I just find it annoying.I truly feel that the Cons are insignificant in compared to the amazing value in this DVD.  I only include them for the sake of veracity.I hope you find this review helpful.

It's called Tamara Lackey's Capturing Life Through (Better) Photography.As the title suggests, this set is aimed at helping anyone who owns a camera learn how use it - well - better. Tamara speaks to non-professional audiences for the first time in this series, and the result is a comprehensive guide for anyone looking to use whatever equipment they've got to make the most of everyday snapshots.While many in the Photofocus audience already have a grasp on this material, it will be of keen interest to those who are constantly asked by friends and family about how to get better at photography.The 90-minute DVD is fast-paced, and offers incredible production quality. The product was filmed by Rex Ballard, Director of ABC's Extreme Makeover: Home Edition. So if it looks like you're watching a professionally-produced television show instead of a cheap web-video it's because you are. This DVD contains straightforward tips from Tamara's professional experience, delivered in an energetic, engaging format - with some silliness thrown in as well. The DVD covers lots of ground, but it is a little light on the side of breaking down photography's more technical aspects. That's where the book comes in.The 100-page book dives right in to some of the toughest camera terminology and vocabulary, tackling the ISO/shutter speed/aperture relationship early on, but doing so in a fun and conversational manner. Tamara's take on how to best understand aperture and shutter speed is one of the freshest explanations I've heard.  It then moves on to breaking down the preset shooting modes seen commonly on most point-and-shoot and starter SLR cameras--what they do, and why they work.  The rest of the book is dedicated to applying Tamara's simple tips on five components of good photography--lighting, composition, background, interaction, and optional equipment and accessories--to scenarios like sports games, birthday parties, dinner with friends, or family portraits.  Filled with stunning imagery and a few really fun illustrations, it's a treat to flip through.The Quick Reference Guide is attractively designed and simple to use. This guide condenses the most important points covered in the DVD and book into a small camera bag-sized booklet. Including key point reminders, exposure charts and aperture diagrams, it reminds you of what you need to know in a style that's easy and encouraging.The three products do not depend on each other, but seem to work best as a set. There's also an accompanying iPhone app in the works.For new photographers - highly recommended.",5,Highly Recommended,1296345600,"01 30, 2011",Sports_and_Outdoors,1

Completion makes it sturdy enough to function. Be careful with assembly, as not all support struts go straight down, and pressure can snap a crooked support scheme. When making the example in the book, you may have to move a weight on the bottom shovel from the side to the top to prevent it from blocking the green loading bay trough. I didn't put gears all over the finished coaster, as they wouldn't move. I added a vertical large gear, using a 9, on the bottom. This spins with the help of a medium horizontal gear, which is next to the extra gear coming off the auger assembly. I also added a large gear to mesh with the water wheel using a 10. To that, I added a medium gear using an 11. I put a piece of scotch tape over the sound holes on the Chamber of Sound to make it bearable. We solved the auger loading problem by adding more marbles for weight to push the other marbles in. We use about 30 large smooth marbles all together. This amount prevents bottlenecks and the lower shovel from getting stuck.

The production values are rather low and the rules horribly written.  If you take the time to really, really sift through the rules you can enjoy this game.The neat thing is that the game comes in many forms.  You can play it solitaire.  Your goal is to clean up crime in Sanctuary.  Or you can play the basic design for two to five players or an advanced version of the same game.  Finally, you can try a six player version (just so you don't leave anyone out.  I found the advanced game the most satisfying.You goal is to commit thefts so that you gain and secure 300 silver pieces.  Along the way you may luck into 10 or 20 silver pieces here or there.  Of course you will lose money as you get thrown in the dungeon, mugged by other players, have bad luck, or choose to buy weapons, thugs, or magic to assist you.In a neat convention, players move their characters and the guards during their turn.  Two six sided dice and one ten sided die are rolled and the player uses two to move his/her character with the remaining die used to move the guard.  In this way players can choose to move the guards away from them, toward their competiton, or hopefully both.  After moving to the designated area players burgle, mug, or pick pocket their way to wealth and retirement.  Fortune smiles on the players in the liberal mecca of Sanctuary as even the worst of thefts results in only a temporary setback - no death or dismemberment here.Overall this is a decent game, but it will take you awhile to find this out.

I really enjoyed the exercises--lots and lots and lots that start you out slow, with good step-by-step instruction, and then work up to the larger and more complicated projects.  The only thing, if you are new, I would not spend a fortune on materials.  Student quality paints (like Cotman) are fine to start and it won't break your heart when you have to start a project over and toss your first attempt.  (Do avoid the boxes of 20 tubes of paint for $12).  Experiment with brush sizes and types; I was not comfortable with a #12 brush which the author suggests.  Brushes in mid-range prices to start off with would be a good idea.

She covers the color wheel, perspective, composition, and every facet of watercolor.  I really enjoyed the exercises--lots and lots and lots that start you out slow, with good step-by-step instruction, and then work up to the larger and more complicated projects.  The only thing, if you are new, I would not spend a fortune on materials.  Student quality paints (like Cotman) are fine to start and it won't break your heart when you have to start a project over and toss your first attempt.  (Do avoid the boxes of 20 tubes of paint for $12).  Experiment with brush sizes and types; I was not comfortable with a #12 brush which the author suggests.  Brushes in mid-range prices to start off with would be a good idea.

I am not only reading the book all the way through, I am studying it, page by page,underlining in red what I need to do, and underlining in blue what I should not do, and am learning so much.

Her tip about having a wet sponge to dab your brush on, to get rid of excess water has saved not only my paintings, but many towels, also.

This book was well recommended by a number of sources, so I got it with several other books. I am quite pleased with Colette Pitcher's presentation in this book.The other books tend to skim topics as if they're unimportant, and leap right into twelve-part petals. Colette takes it slow. She explains how transparent watercolors are see-through, while opaque (non-see-through) watercolors tend to have Chinese white in them. And then there are acrylics, which are also opaque, but these dry solidly. They won't re-wet. These kinds of details are important, quite helpful, and other similar books don't seem to cover them.She talks about how old watercolors had issues with fading in light, but that newer ones are much sturdier. That a key to watercolor's luminosity is that light shines through the transparent layers, bounces off the paper behind it, and reflects back at our eyes, giving it a glow. She talks not only about painting, but about spattering, using non-brush objects to make textures, and much more.She covers the emotions of painting. She says ""art tends to be stuffy, pretentious, and cerebral."" Instead, she pushes us to be relaxed and free. Practice every day, even for a few minutes. Buy inexpensive but good quality gear - don't let yourself quit out of frustration with cheap, inferior tools. Play with ""blooming"" paint and other ""errors"". Make your own color charts to know how your particular paints work. And, most of all, have patience. Let yourself rediscover a child-like awe of the world.She gives guidance on showing your artwork. Use white mats for art shows, and avoid cardboard / newsprint backings as the acid will damage the watercolor paper. Make sure the mat keeps the glass from touching the print, and look into glare free / UV blocking glass. She talks about drawing basics, for developing your starting sketches, and how to make a tic-tac-toe grid to place items of interest. She even provides a set of ""course assignments"" on things to work on, to develop your skills.There are only a few issues with the book. First, I found a few typos and layout issues that should have been caught and fixed. This isn't a self-published book; the Dummies publishing group is massive. Their editors should know by now how to proof a book. Next, the examples given for us to follow don't ramp up smoothly. First we're dabbing paint randomly on a page, and then we're constructing a full landscape. I'd like to see more steps in between about how to make trees, for example.Still, compared with the other options out there, this is a great guide with a wealth of information.

All of these points will improve our sense of well being.I like this particular Mandala coloring book by Marty Noble because it is a bit more complicated that her other mandala coloring books.  These are very traditional type designs that exhibit ancient sacred designs that span across several spiritual traditions.  They are easily removed from the book to work one at a time.  Four Star:  The designs are on each page, front and back.  This means you cannot use alcohol markers or markers that will bleed through the paper and ruin the other side.  Use high quality coloring pencils for best results.Creative Suggestion: Is to put your favorite design on an overhead projector, shine it on a chosen spot on a blank canvas and trace it. Then fill in with acrylics or oils or even water colors. Or you could complete this same process and project on a wall.

It doesn't take up the entire page like the rest of the books do. The design is in the center, and there is quite a bit of white, blank page, left all around it on every side.

I love that I have small children still (9 and 2) that I can color with, without looking completely silly (Not that I'd really care).  Coloring is relaxing.I stumbled across this book when I was looking for art supplies, and coloring books for my 17-year-old. (I typed in 'coloring book for teens' on a whim).  And I was happy to find these designs by Marty Noble.  The price was reasonable, and the quality is nice.  It's not a thick (lots of pages) coloring book like you would find for small children, only around 40 pages, I think.  But the pages aren't thin like a child's coloring book either.  They are a little thicker.  A little better quality.  Nice bold white sheets.  I'm thinking you may be able to use markers on this without them bleeding through, but I don't know for sure yet.  I'm going to try it.I'm pleased with my purchase, and will definitely be ordering more.",5,A coloring book for ME!  If only I'd known earlier!,1388102400,"12 27, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1

I will try to get a picture of the inside in the next few days, and post it here for you to see.Despite that, I do love the design.  (Just wish it were bigger, taking up more of the page.)  I love coloring.  It doesn't matter to me what it is, I just like to color.  I love that I have small children still (9 and 2) that I can color with, without looking completely silly (Not that I'd really care).  Coloring is relaxing.I stumbled across this book when I was looking for art supplies, and coloring books for my 17-year-old. (I typed in 'coloring book for teens' on a whim).  And I was happy to find these designs by Marty Noble.  The price was reasonable, and the quality is nice.  It's not a thick (lots of pages) coloring book like you would find for small children, only around 40 pages, I think.  But the pages aren't thin like a child's coloring book either.  They are a little thicker.  A little better quality.  Nice bold white sheets.  I'm thinking you may be able to use markers on this without them bleeding through, but I don't know for sure yet.  I'm going to try it.I'm pleased with my purchase, and will definitely be ordering more.",5,A coloring book for ME!  If only I'd known earlier!,1388102400,"12 27, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1

It is a two player game where one side plays the Lord of Pestilence (the diseases) and another plays the Apothecary Healers (the medicinal agents for countering the diseases). It was developed by two medical doctors who also happen to be gamers, Francis Kong and Arun Mathews. From what I've read, it is growing in popularity with medical students.When I first heard about this, the first thing I thought of was an academic paper my wife had ran across and told me about by Richard Steinman and Mary Blastos called ""A trading-card game teaching about host defence"" from 2002. The paper concluded concluded that the game was super-effective for teaching the concepts. The two are unrelated, to my knowledge, but share the same conceptual space. Both the game in the paper and The Healing Blade are games... that teach. But on to this game.It's a beautiful game. It has high-quality components, and great art. There are 20 green glass beads included to track the energy resource used, ATP (adenosine triphosphate). Each player has a full-color playmat. And most of the 90 cards have unique art. The art is definitely worth mentioning here... it would definitely hold its own against Magic: The Gathering art. Gorgeous illustratiuons. Altogether, a very impressive set of components.And then... the cards. Okay, here is where the diseases come in. Each Lord of Pestilence card has the full scientific name of the disease (Streptococcus pneumoniae or Helicobacter pylori, as examples), its abbreviated common name (S. pneumoniae, H. pylori) and a fantasy-style piece of art that represents it, plus flavortext that puts a magical spin on its real-world effect. Each Apothecary Healer card has the name of a medicine (ie, Doxycyclene) and its own art and flavortext. Aside from a small font, they are very well put together.As for gameplay... let's say that this was the funnest study session I've ever had on infectious diseases. Which is to say that as a game, the mechanics do leave a little to be desired. The rules are pretty concise and simple, but in playing we found a couple situations not covered in the rules. For instance, as the Lord of Pestilence, I found my hand of cards clogged with high-cost diseases that I was unable to play. The result was that my Apothecary Healer opponent was able to build up and have a healer combatant that could counter most diseases I could play. It could have just been a bad run, and I noticed on their site a rules revision is in progress. So... the current gameplay isn't tight, mechanics-wise... but as I see it, that's not an issue. Because mechanics are not the point.What this game represents is a great step in the right direction for games that teach. If I were a medical student, I would absolutely love this game. This beats the heck out of a dry textbook. Granted, it doesn't replace the textbook, but it is a great supplement that presents the material in a way that activates different parts of the brain. This would be a great supplement to a class on pathogens. It slaps a fun theme on the subject of infectious diseases and how to fight them, and runs with it. I hands-down recommend this for any med student out there. For gamers? Not so much. But keep your eye out: the next rules revision may very well put this mechanically closer to the games we play just for fun. I suspect we may start seeing more hobby-quality games whose primary purpose is to help us learn.

The stickers are &#34;puffy&#34; like what I remember of stickers in the 80s but they don't rip or become damaged otherwise when you try and peel them off to reposition them in order to create scenes. I expect that it will take a reasonable amount of time for my 5 yo daughter to fill up the pages but there are two more designs of this sticker album from Sticker Farm and I fully intended to get the other ones if/when my daughter fills up this book. I balked at the price initially but this set has been well worth the money.",5,FINALLY! A sturdy and high-quality sticker book for my kid!!!,1365897600,"04 14, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1

She immediately sat down at a table and began creating her own little scenes and scenarios. The book provides a nice balance of structure (each pair of pages sets a basic environment) while still enabling open-ended creativity (by providing a palette of stickers that the child can place within the environment).Highly recommended!,5,My five year-old daughter loved it!,1321488000,"11 17, 2011",Toys_and_Games,1

You can add more tiles to the twenty-four you are initially alloted, so as long as it works out that each player would receive an equal amount of turns.  If you have four players for example, you could add twenty-eight or thirty-two tiles instead.  You can opt to play a longer game, or you can play the standard game which lasts about an hour, sometimes less, depending on how quick players are in forming words.The variant listed in the manual is a welcome addition to the main game and was received well by my son and me.  It gave us more options in the beginning, as we were often struggling to find words using the normal setup.  The variant also suggests the use of a sand timer (not included in the main game) to help speed things along, which is a good idea if you are pressed for time.  I normally leave out timers in the games we review to encourage the kids to think about all of their options.Since there are seventy-one tiles and you are using less than a third of them in each game, the replay value ends up being extremely high.  Add the fact that you have pawns blocking each other's movements and bonus tiles that provide various effects...two games end up never being the same.Aside from its replayability, it is very educational.  This game forces players to expand their vocabulary and adapt to the letters that they are presented with.  This would be an excellent game for kids as it promotes learning and creative thinking.  Using this game as a practice aid for spelling and vocabulary in the classroom is very doable.  The teacher (or parent) could pick and choose which twenty-four tiles are in the game, based on the kinds of words that they are practicing at the time.My son struggled at first, not understanding the difference between laying a tile down and starting a word where the pawn was.  He quickly came to see after a few turns however that you can strategically place your letter tiles in such a way that your pawn could utilize it.  The game went very quickly (about thirty minutes) and we tied at fifty-nine points each.  For our first game, I stacked the ""deck"" with more greens and yellows to help ease him into learning the game.  He was trying out different letter combinations and sometimes asked if what he proposed was a word...which is exactly the kind of interaction that I was hoping would result from playing together.  He was being encouraged to think outside of the box and expand his vocabulary...a plus for any parent worth his (or her) two cents.Overall, this is an excellent game to introduce to your family on family game night.  Its high replayability allows for hours of fun, while keeping your mind and vocabulary sharp in the process.",4,WayWord Review by Dad's Gaming Addiction,1381190400,"10 8, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1
